This is rewrite of RavLog by Gerda Shank replacing Catalyst with WebNano.

The current revision requires latest WebNano from github.

To install prerequisites use 'dzil listdeps | cpanm' or run 'dzil build' 
and install the created CPAN-ready distribution the normal way.

Then proceed with the instructions in INSTALL.
